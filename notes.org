Goal: Create a toy dataset which we believe to have a form amenable to filtering
Result:
- I became stuck with a number of technical issues working on my laptop
- The ERAData package seems to have strange defaults (it requires a date range to be entered, and then it blanked on
  me, throwing a hard to parse error
- My settings for python inside of emacs didn't work, it somehow seems the interpretter setting is being ignored.

Next steps:
- Ask Silius about the ERAData code, maybe first doing a git blame
- Try to find an alternative setting for the default python interpretter

I am writing a note to discuss what I am trying to build.
